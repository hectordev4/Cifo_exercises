# What's the status of my goals and projects?
My main goal was achieving to connect my vaadin-hilla to Dynamodb, which I did last week. So it means that my frontend could connect to the backend and this one connect with my credentials to my Dyanomdb on AWS.

Now my last goal is to completely apply my styles and views over the templates from hilla, and for doing that I need to finish 

# What's going well?
Theme Implementation, Context Injection. Also I did pretty backwork as Mockups, user stories and feature list.

# What's going poorly?
I need to speed on features like the visual to finish implementing contexts, and filters for the views. And above all the user and admin views.

# Am I on track?
Yes, I am on track. Now that I've done the past exam I can fully focus on the exercise. During the past weeks I've been closing open tasks from the exercise and my personal life.

# Are my major goals still my most important goals?

Yes, now that I did half of the work from my main goals I can focus on the views and context to end it.
