## What did I achieve to manage?

### Set-up projects and IDEs

One of the startups for this course was working with IDEs, the workspace to develop the code, and starting new projects.
<br>

I managed to start from scratch React+Vite projects and also to manage the Java projects made out from springboot. I know how to do and where to find the documentation in case I can't figure out some details.

### Frameworks to work with in Frontend and Backend

As a newbie in software development I had to catch a lot of knowledge and background. So within the first days of the course I was introduced to React and Java, programming languages/frameworks that I never touched.
<br>

The key was to focus and apply SCRUM (which I'll talk later) on daily basis. I needed to timebox my days, weeks and months to be able to keep up the pace of the course, and so I did.
<br>

I started to check the MOOC from Helsinki's University and the documentation from React in its website to practice and get to the bottom of every line of code I needed to write and being able to do all of the exercises and understand all of the classes I'd assist.
<br>

In the actual date I did successfully the "Describing the UI", "Adding Interactivity" and "Managing State" from the react.dev page,and currently finishing the part 4 from MOOC's Java Programming 1.

### One Git to rule'em all

My archenemy in this evaluation I'd say it's Git. With all the possibilities to manage and control your projects and repositories, it was very hard to keep the order when you do something wrong.
<br>

I had to review a lots of times the documentation from Git in search for a way to fix the mess I did. So one must in every developer is to ensure the full control in the commands made via terminal or IDE to ensure the correct clone, commit, push & pull, etc.. in all of the projects currently working, even old repositories.

<br>

    Git is immutable.

### SCRUM & Agile Methodologies

Fell in love at first sight. That was my feel with every step closer to fully known this methodologies.
<br>

Every methodology that exists has its pros & cons, but I found in these ones a deep approach to my way of work. I am a non conventionalist in the sense of doing things and work the subjects. I was always very frustrated with the common system applied from the very beginning in schools to the very last in daily jobs and corporations here.
<br>

I was always thriving for the best optimization of myself doing all kinds of works. How can I fit? How can I be better? How can I stop producing waste?
<br>

Here I found most of the answers I was looking for. A way to be understood by my work colleages, the approach in the way of focusing tasks, timeboxing my time and stop wasting it. I'd venture to say I found the right shoe for my foot.
<br>

All I hope for is keep improving and pushing my knowledge to its limit and be able to deep dive and find mind alike partners to work with in the future.

<br>

### Markdown and its capabilities

Here I was taught the correct way to document all my projects and evaluations even the sprints commented in SCRUM methodology. Markdown is a great tool when it comes to that.
<br>

With markdown I can efficiently write down all kind of anotations keeping a solid structure with the minimum add-ons. Everything else is just noise or not relevant in order to write a clear and structured message or instructions.
<br>

With the next documentation comes a great valuable cheatsheet to know the most used and handy anotations to add clarity and order to your texts.
