## Cloud-Native Backend Engineering

### AWS DynamoDB Mastery

**Advanced Database Operations:**

Implemented sophisticated NoSQL patterns:

- **Single-Table Design**: Dual table architecture for Delegations/Cars and Users/Bookings
- **Scan vs Query Optimization**: Strategic use of scan operations with filter expressions
- **Generic Repository Pattern**: Type-safe operations across multiple entity types
- **Enhanced Client Integration**: AWS SDK v2 with TableSchema mapping [1](#8-0) 

**Performance Insights:**

| Operation | Implementation | Optimization Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Car Listing | DynamoDB Scan with filter | `begins_with(operation, :val)` expression |
| Booking Generation | SHA-256 hashing | Unique identifier creation |
| Type Safety | Hilla code generation | Automatic TypeScript client generation |

### Cloud Authentication Architecture

**AWS Cognito Implementation:**

- Complete user lifecycle: sign-up, sign-in, confirmation, password recovery
- JWT token management with session storage
- Custom UI implementation (not hosted UI)
- Integration with React routing and protected routes

---

## Advanced Frontend Development

### React + TypeScript Mastery

**Component Architecture Achievements:**

- **Type-Safe API Integration**: Leveraged Hilla's automatic TypeScript generation
- **Advanced Hooks Pattern**: Custom hooks for state management and API calls
- **External API Integration**: imagin.studio for dynamic car images with fallback handling
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox-based card layouts with Vaadin components

**Key Implementation Patterns:**

```typescript
// Sophisticated booking hash generation
async function generateBookingHash(data: {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  userId: string;
}): Promise<string>
```

### State Management Evolution

**Advanced Patterns Implemented:**

- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated API logic and state management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch patterns with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Graceful handling of async operations
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking for data validation

---

## Cloud Services Integration

### AWS Services Mastery

**Services Implemented:**

- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database with single-table design patterns
- **Cognito**: Complete authentication and user management
- **SDK Integration**: AWS SDK v2 for Java with Enhanced Client

**Architecture Patterns:**
