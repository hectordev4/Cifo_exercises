# 2nd Trimester Evaluation - Continued Progress

## Advanced React Component Development

### Component Architecture and Reusability
- Successfully implemented complex component hierarchies in PRA-03 (Weather App) and PRA-05 (Airport Management)
- Developed reusable components:
  - `CardMap` with draggable markers and minimap control
  - `ToggleMode` with system preference detection
  - `DataTable` with dynamic column generation
  - Form components with consistent validation patterns

### State Management
- Advanced usage of React hooks:
  - Context-based state management for theme switching
  - Custom hooks for data fetching and modal management
  - Performance optimization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`

### UI/UX Improvements
- Enhanced interfaces with:
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Animations in Weather components
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Accessibility considerations

## Backend Development with Spring Boot

### Advanced JPA Usage
- Implemented complex entity relationships:
  - Airport ↔ Flight ↔ Plane relationships
  - Category ↔ Word relationships (PRA-04)
- Mastered sequence generation for IDs
- Improved database operations with batch processing

### REST API Development
- Designed comprehensive REST endpoints
- Advanced features implemented:
  - Batch creation endpoints
  - Flight filtering by departure/arrival
  - Pagination support
- Proper DTO pattern implementation

### Database Management
- H2 database configuration
- SQL scripts for:
  - Data initialization
  - Sequence resetting
  - Schema management

## Full-Stack Integration

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- Proper CORS configuration
- Consistent API URL management
- Comprehensive HTTP request examples
- Form-DTO mirroring implementation

### Error Handling
- Consistent patterns:
  - Frontend form validation
  - Backend exception handling
  - Loading states during API calls

## Development Process Improvements

### Code Organization
- Project structure refactoring:
  - Service layer organization
  - Component hierarchy
  - State management
- Separation of concerns

### Documentation
- Detailed commit messages
- HTTP request examples
- Comprehensive SQL scripts

## New Technical Skills

### Libraries and Tools
- Leaflet/React-Leaflet
- ShadCN UI components
- Radix UI primitives
- react-hook-form with Zod
- Postman for API testing

### Build and Configuration
- Vite project configuration
- Environment variables management
- Database sequence generators

## Areas for Continued Growth

1. **Testing**:
   - Implement comprehensive test suites
   - Unit and integration testing

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Caching strategies
   - Query optimization

3. **Advanced State Management**:
   - Evaluate Redux alternatives
   - Context API optimization

4. **Architecture**:
   - Microservices exploration
   - Monolith decomposition

5. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Automated deployment
   - Continuous integration

## Conclusion

This trimester has shown substantial growth in full-stack capabilities, from basic CRUD to complex system architecture. The ability to design cohesive applications has improved significantly, with better anticipation of frontend-backend impacts.

**Next trimester focus**:
- Deepen existing skills
- Add testing expertise
- Implement deployment pipelines
- Explore advanced architectural patterns
